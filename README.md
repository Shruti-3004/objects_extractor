Product & Brand Detection from Videos using OpenAI Vision
This project automatically detects and identifies branded products from video scenes using OpenCV for scene change detection and OpenAI’s GPT-4o vision model for product classification. It is tailored for retail analysis, advertising intelligence, and consumer research.

Features

--> Scene change detection using histogram correlation

--> Product recognition using OpenAI's GPT-4o (Vision model)

--> Deduplication and normalization of product names

--> Results are saved in a CSV with a log of processed videos

--> Skips reprocessing already analyzed videos

--> Handles errors gracefully with informative feedback

Setup Instructions

1. Clone or copy the project
2. Place your videos in the videos/ folder
Make sure your video filenames start with a keyword like may (e.g., maybelline_ad.mp4) to match the current file glob pattern in the script.
3. Add your OpenAI API key
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
4. Run the code
Run the cells in the notebook

The output will be saved to detected_objects.csv.

Output
The script creates/updates the detected_objects.csv file with the following columns:

video	products
videos/maybelline.mp4	Maybelline Super Stay Foundation, Maybelline Fit Me Blush, ...

Customization
Adjust Scene Change Sensitivity
Modify the threshold in is_scene_change():

if is_scene_change(prev_frame, gray, threshold=0.8):
Lower threshold → more sensitive to changes
Higher threshold → less sensitive

Modify the Prompt
You can tune the prompt inside identify_objects() to make it stricter or more lenient depending on the product categories you’re targeting.

Error Handling
Videos already analyzed are skipped to avoid redundancy

If a video fails during processing, the error is printed with a message

Vision API errors are caught and handled safely

Limitations

--> Requires stable internet connection and OpenAI API usage quota
--> GPT-based vision detection can sometimes hallucinate — consider adding additional filters if needed
--> OCR is not used; the system relies purely on vision-language inference

Potential Enhancements
Add OCR fallback using PaddleOCR or EasyOCR

Integrate object detectors (e.g., YOLO) for region proposals before LLM call

Add GUI or web interface to explore processed data

Add product image thumbnails in CSV for review
